This was a task in the codecademy web development career path.

# Dog Factory function

1. Write a function, dogFactory(). It should:

   - have 3 parameters: name, breed, and weight (in that order)
   - expect weight to be a number
   - return an object
   - have each of those parameters as keys on the returned object returned with the values of the arguments that were passed in

2. Add getters and setters for each of the three properties and change the property names to have an underscore prepended. Expect name and breed to be strings

3. Add two methods to your object: .bark() which returns ‘ruff! ruff!’ and .eatTooManyTreats() which should increment the weight property by 1.
